### How do you summarize your work?
To multiply my impact, I build and lead teams focused on customer success, grounded in great technical content that provides clarity about product truth. 

My teams have succeeded because of our focus on customers and our commitment to simplify. I also love to use the tools and technologies. My language of choice is JavaScript. I also have experience with Java.
