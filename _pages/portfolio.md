### How do you summarize your work?
To multiply my impact, I build and lead teams focused on customer success. 

My teams have succeeded because of our commitment to simplify the user experience. I also love to use the tools and technologies. My language of choice is JavaScript. I also have experience with Java. 

### Accomplishments
* (Recent) Lead 200-person development team to adopt data-driven, performance-focused resourcing model. 
* (Mid career) Selected by executive leadership to create global program management organization designed to baseline contributions and defects, and subsequently increase contributions and reduce defects. 
* (Early career) Supervised 15-person team in support 23,000 unique customers. We moved from monthly updates to continuous deployments that demonstrated commitment to listening to customer feedback. Opened a customer feedback channel where we met a 3-day SLA for responding to issues.
