I share a few of the recent books that I've read to highlight some great work that you might like too:

## On writing

Thoughts about some of the books I've read recently...

28 May 2019

Finished [*Barking to the Choir*](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1476726159/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=arobertson0f-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=1476726159&linkId=23e8d80df188b341ce2592c3317b510d). Stunning. Not sure why it doesn't get the praise I heard about [*Tattoos on the Heart*](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1439153159/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=arobertson0f-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=1439153159&linkId=d015a0d74259dc8f5ba7ed02d0a4e059). While I am not a religious person, I am spiritual. Both books deeply affected me in the best way.

I finished [*Better*](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0312427654/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=arobertson0f-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0312427654&linkId=f19fc436256e71deee0c644100ddda08)
 today. Glad I picked this book back up after I started and stopped reading it in January. At the end, he talks about writing and how we should all want to be better than mediocre really hit me. I know I reach burnout when I do not want to write. It's my desire to always be better than leads to burnout. Such a lovely, messy paradox. Perhaps Gawande will write about this topic in a future book.
