In all things, my goal is to simplify complexity.

### Were you always a manager?
No. Before I was a manager, I was a lead and an individual contributor. I got into management after a series of bad managers and one good manager. That awesome manager inspired me to take the leap into becoming a multiplier.

### Where did you go to school?
After starting my undergraduate education at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, I transferred to North Carolina State University. I earned a Bachelors and Masters degree from North Carolina State University (go Wolfpack!)

### Do you have a personal life?
Yes, I'm married and have two children. Because we like to eat, I make foods from around the world as a way to explore different cultures and practices.

I am also an enthusiastic endurance runner and aspiring long-distance swimmer.
