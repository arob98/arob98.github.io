### What is your goal?
To live simply. In my work, this translates into simplifying complexity. 

### What is your current role?
I am a senior leader who is curious and tenacious. Motivated by the opportunity to positively impact the customer experience, design, architecture, and implementation of cutting-edge technologies, I lead a team of people at Microsoft. 

### Were you always a manager?
No. Before I was a manager, I was a lead and an individual contributor. I got into management after a series of bad managers and one good manager. That awesome manager inspired me to take the leap into becoming a multiplier.

### Where did you go to school?
After starting my undergraduate education at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, I transferred to North Carolina State University. I earned a Bachelors and Masters degree from North Carolina State University (go Wolfpack!)

### Do you have a personal life?
Yes, of course. I'm married and have two children. I am an enthusiastic endurance runner. I also love to read and to assemble jigsaw puzzles.
